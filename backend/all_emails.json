Manual observation is  \r\ntime-consuming and inconsistent, and current ML models still struggle to  \r\ngeneralize across labs and settings.\r\n\r\nIn this competition, you'll develop ML models to detect and classify 38  \r\ndifferent social and non-social behaviors in co-housed mice using  \r\nmarkerless motion capture from top-down video. With over 400 hours of  \r\nexpertly labeled footage from 20+ recording systems, the dataset challenges  \r\nyou to match or exceed the accuracy of human observers across diverse  \r\nenvironments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTotal Prizes:\r\n\r\n$50,000\r\n\r\n\r\nEntry Deadline:\r\n\r\nDecember 8, 2025\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLearn More\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYour work could make behavioral research more scalable and consistent,  \r\nsupporting new discoveries in neuroscience, computational biology and other  \r\nfields.\r\n\r\nGood luck,\r\n\r\nSohier Dane\r\nKaggle Data Scientist\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKaggle, Inc 1600 Amphitheatre Pkwy Mountain View, CA 94043\r\n\r\nThis email was sent to prophishy@gmail.com because you indicated that you'd  \r\nlike to receive news and updates about Kaggle.
